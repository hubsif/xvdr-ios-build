Binary and script to build xvdr for XBMC/Kodi on a Mac

When I couldn't find a current binary of the [XBMC/Kodi xvdr addon] [1] for iOS, I searched
the internet to find a way to compile it myself.
I ended up with the bash script uploaded here, which is based on the [generic bash script] [2]
I found on [stackoverflow.com] [3]. It's a dirty hack only, so you might hit errors on your machine :).

You can find the binary I compiled [here] [4].

To build an iOS binary yourself on your Mac, simply run the script from inside the xvdr directory,
of course with the necessary development tools like XCode installed.
